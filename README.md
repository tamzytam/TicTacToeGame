# TicTacToeGame
The above code is a Tic Tac Toe game written in C#. It consists of several functions that handle different aspects of the game. The Main method serves as the entry point of the program and contains the game loop that runs until a win or a draw is determined.

The DisplayBoard function takes in the game board represented as a 2D array of characters and displays it on the console. The GetPlayerMove function takes in the current player and prompts them to make a move by entering a row and column number. The IsWin function takes in the game board and the current player and returns true if the player has won the game and false otherwise. The IsDraw function takes in the game board and returns true if the game is a draw and false otherwise.

Overall, this Tic Tac Toe program allows two players to play the game on the console, keeps track of the game board, and determines the outcome of the game.
